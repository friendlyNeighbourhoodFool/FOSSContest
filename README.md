# FOSSContest

Link to the hosted web page:- https://vast-bayou-47043.herokuapp.com/
This project is an idea in which this website will bring together, information about all the IIITs and their amazing information ,in one place.
****This project is inspired from IIITian Community***
At present it is equipped with:-

1.)User authentication.

2.)A user can add/edit/delete his own post and comments and cannot do so with a post/comment of another user.

3.)The backend idea about this webpage is pretty much setup and some design changes are to be made to the webpages for aesthetic values.

4.)I have attached a concept change that will be implemented to the current login page in my mail reply to the thread.

5.)Landing page is pretty much all done in the front end section as well.
